# Redis Streams Issue and Solution

## Problem

The Redis streams for customers and orders were not working correctly. Data was being successfully added to the Redis streams, but it was not being processed and saved to MongoDB. This was happening because:

1. The stream consumer functionality was defined in two places:

   - In `src/app.js` (incomplete implementation)
   - In `src/services/streamConsumer.js` (complete implementation)

2. The stream consumer in `src/services/streamConsumer.js` was not being started when running the application.

## Solution

The solution was to run the stream consumer as a separate process. We created scripts in `package.json` to make this easier:

```json
"scripts": {
  "consumer": "node src/services/streamConsumer.js",
  "dev:full": "concurrently \"npm run dev\" \"npm run consumer\"",
  "start:full": "concurrently \"npm run start\" \"npm run consumer\""
}
```

## Testing

We created test scripts to verify the functionality:

1. `testRedisStreams.js` - Tests adding data to Redis streams and checking if it appears in MongoDB
2. `testStreamConsumer.js` - Tests the stream consumer functionality directly

## How to Run

To ensure Redis streams are working correctly, always run both the API server and the stream consumer:

```bash
npm run dev:full  # For development
npm run start:full  # For production
```

Or run them separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev  # or npm start for production

# Terminal 2
npm run consumer
```

## Verification

You can verify that the stream consumer is running with:

```bash
ps aux | grep streamConsumer
```

And check the Redis consumer groups with:

```bash
redis-cli xinfo consumers customer_ingest crm-consumer-group
```

If the stream consumer is running correctly, you should see a consumer with a low "idle" time.

## Important Note

If you're adding customers or orders through the API and they're not appearing in MongoDB, make sure the stream consumer is running. The API endpoints only add data to Redis streams; the stream consumer is responsible for processing that data and saving it to MongoDB.
